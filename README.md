## Royale Calculator
A simple web app that allows you to calculate how many cards, requests, and gold you'll need to max out a card in Super Cell's Clash Royale. 

### `Bugs / Known Issues`
- The **# of Cards Owned** text field needs a min and max according to the card rarity and card level selected. Right now the app will return negative numbers. 

### 'Future Development Plans`
- Eventually want to create iOS and Android apps
- The user interface can still use a lot of work and I want to add smooth animations and transitions
- Implement the Clash Royale API and allow users to view a complete list of all their cards with the amount of cards, requests, and gold needed for each individual card
